                    <h1>Make your Work from Home Fun!</h1>
                    <br />
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hello! Here are some exciting games that you can play with your teams, work buddies and even your friends for as long as you need to Work from Home. I try to organize something new for my teammates every week. There’s also some ideas for birthday celebrations at the end! If you have any exciting games/activities, please do let me know <a href="https://aditibhat.com" target="_blank">here</a>. I’ll add the activity and give you credit!</p>
                    <h2>Pictionary</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I think this one is my team’s personal favourite! Their kids would join in and help out, which made it even more fun. Their frustration when their parents made spelling mistakes or when their drawings completely unrecognizable was hilarious. There are two websites you can use for this. Although I prefer <a href="https://skribbl.io/" target="_blank">skribbl.io</a>, the drawback (pun intended) is that a maximum of 12 people can play. With <a href="https://drawsaurus.org" target="_blank">drawsaurus</a>, upto 20 people can play and that’s why it was perfect for our team. Here’s an example for Pictionary, take a shot at guessing the word I drew! You can see the number of letters in the word at the top. The answer will be revealed at the end of the article :P </p>

                    <h2>Guess Who</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;For this game, all you need to do is ask you teammates to send in a childhood picture and a fun fact about themselves. Compile all of them and turn it into a guessing game! The fun fact would first be provided and then the childhood picture would be a clue. You can switch that up if necessary. You get to learn new things about your teammates and get to see what they looked like. (Yes I got this idea while watching The Office :P). Here was my fun fact and childhood picture!</p>

                    <h2>Housie/Tambola!</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I’m sure most of you have played Housie/Tambola at some sort of Family Get-Together! In case you haven’t here’s a small refresher: Each person gets a ticket with some numbers on it. The person conducting the game calls out random numbers from 1-99. If you have the number in your ticket, you mark it! If you are the first person to get all the numbers of a category, you win! There are four categories: First row, second row, third row and Full House. Here’s how we conducted the game:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We used <a href="https://chandoo.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bingo-housie-ticket-generator-excel-sheet.xlsx" target="_blank">this excel sheet</a> to generate housie tickets.</li>
                        <li>We copied the tickets into a mail with people’s names on it, sent it to the entire team.</li>
                        <li>We used <a href="http://yash.info/bingo.htm" target="_blank">this number generator </a>. This was open on my laptop and the screen was shared with the entire team, so everyone could see the numbers being generated. I also called out the numbers.</li>
                        <li>There were four winners – First Row, Second row, Third Row, Full House!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="/images/blogs/WFH/housie.jpg" />
                    <br />
                    <h2>Scavenger Hunt</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This one is an idea that I got from <a href="https://zoomjam.org/?p=236" target="_blank">here</a>. This game will make you get up from your chairs and get some light exercise too! Essentially, you have to search for items around your house, and rush back to the computer to show it to your teammates. The first person to bring a valid item wins! To decide what things you need to hunt, we used a dice. You can use a physical dice or a mobile/web dice app. Roll it once to decide the colour of the object, and a second time to decide the shape. We played three levels: First with colour (Ex. Something Yellow), then with shape (Something Square) and then with both combined (Ex. Something Yellow and Square)! Here’s the key we used, you can customize it:</p>

                    <p>Round 1: Colour! Dice Key: 1. Red 2. Blue 3. Yellow 4. Green 5. Black 6. Pink</p>
                    <p>Round 2: Shape! Dice Key: 1. Square 2. Cylinder 3. Circle 4. Triangle 5. Rectangle 6. Oval</p>
                    <p>Round 3: Now Roll the dice twice!</p>
                    {/* <h3>Dice Roll - Colour</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Red</li>
                        <li>Blue</li>
                        <li>Yellow</li>
                        <li>Green</li>
                        <li>Black</li>
                        <li>Pink</li>
                    </ol> */}
                    {/* <h3>Dice Roll - Shape</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Square</li>
                        <li>Cylinder</li>
                        <li>Circle</li>
                        <li>Triangle</li>
                        <li>Rectangle</li>
                        <li>Oval</li>
                    </ol> */}
                    <p>Here's me and my team posing with Yellow rectangles!</p>

                    <br />
                    <h2>Quiz!</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;With MyQuiz, you can create a custom quiz and the fastest person to answer all questions wins! You can set a time limit for each question. The best part is that your team members don’t have to create separate accounts, they can just login with the passcode to your quiz. It even generates a leaderboard for you that looks like this!</p>
                    <img src="/images/blogs/WFH/Quiz_leaderboard.JPG"></img>
                    <br />
                    
                    <h2>Scattergories</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This game is very similar to Name Place Animal Thing! You will be given a letter and a list of categories, and the first one to list items for each category starting with that letter is the winner! We altered it so that the person who enters the answers into the zoom chat box first is the winner within 120s. Here’s what I gave my team:</p>
                    {/* <p>Letter: P</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mobile Applications</li>
                        <li>TV Shows</li>
                        <li>Things that are White</li>
                        <li>Math Terms</li>
                        <li>Parts of a Computer</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Letter: B</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Personality Traits</li>
                        <li>Singer/Band</li>
                        <li>Fictional Characters</li>
                        <li>Languages</li>
                        <li>Electronic Gadgets</li>
                    </ol> */}
                    <br />
                    <img src="/images/blogs/WFH/scattergories.jpg" />
                    <br />
                    <h2>Fastest Fingers First!</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>As the name suggests, whoever guesses the answer first wins this game! We had three rounds, all conducted on Zoom.</p>
                    <p><b>Task 1</b>: Someone has to dictate a sentence, and everyone has to type it as fast as possible into the chat box! The first eight people advance to the next round.</p>
                    <p><b>Task 2</b>: A celebrity’s picture is flashed onto the screen for the second task. The first four people to type the person’s full name into the chat box proceed to the final round!</p>
                    <p><b>The Grand Finale!</b> The Grand Finale involves Zoom’s Whiteboard feature. I think something similar is available in Microsoft Teams, but I haven’t tried it myself. The four finalists have to draw something and the fastest and most accurate one is the winner! We made the finalists draw simple shapes and then the Indian Flag.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Mafia/Werewolves</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>I haven’t tried this out with my team yet, but I found <a href="https://anjuansimmons.com/blog/how-to-play-werewolf-over-zoom/" target="_blank">this website</a> which elaborately explains how you can play Mafia/Werewolves over Zoom! You can also try out <a href="https://secrethitler.io" target="blank">secrethitler.io</a>, which is of a similar genre.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Codenames</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>This is also something I haven’t tried with the team yet, but I play it with my friends quite often! If your team likes word games, you have got to try this. You can use <a href="https://www.freeboardgames.org/play/secretcodes/">this website</a> to play it. </p>
                    <h2>Virtual Tea!</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>This was my manager’s idea! We made tea for our families and joined in on a video call, just like we would in office. Here’s a picture!</p>
                    <img src="/images/blogs/WFH/VirtualTea.JPG" />
                    <br />
                    <h2>Birthdays!</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>The lockdown has really put a damper on birthdays in general, but I thought this could be an opportunity to spice them up! The first time we had a birthday in our team, we had a surprise video call for the person. When he joined, we were all holding sheets of paper with Happy Birthday written on it! By the second time, I had discovered Zoom’s whiteboard feature, so we decided to make a birthday card with that! Here’s what we came up with:</p>
                    <img src="/images/blogs/WFH/birthday.jpg"></img>
                    <br />
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;With many of us working from home indefinitely, I hope that this article helps you break the monotony and have some fun! You can play these games with friends and family too. If you liked any of these, I would be very happy to know, you can reach out to me <a href="https://aditibhat.com" target="_blank">here</a>. And like I mentioned at the beginning, send in activities that you have enjoyed with your teams! </p>
                    <p>P.S. The Pictionary word is fireman!</p>
